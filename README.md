# Matterport Tagging with Excel Data in React.js

Welcome to the repository for our Matterport Tagging project with Excel data integration in React.js! This project aims to create a web-based application using React.js for tagging Matterport models with data imported from Excel files.

## Features

    Matterport Integration: Utilize the Matterport SDK to load and interact with 3D models from Matterport's platform within the React.js application.
    Excel Data Import: Implement functionality to import data from Excel files, such as tag information and associated metadata.
    Tagging Functionality: Enable users to tag specific locations within the Matterport models using data imported from Excel files.
    Dynamic Rendering: Dynamically render tags and associated metadata within the Matterport viewer based on the imported Excel data.
    User Interaction: Allow users to interact with tags within the Matterport viewer.

## Getting Started
